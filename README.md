# EdgeTX_HEV_Suit_Soundpack
This is a *very* low effort edgeTX soundpack to sound like the HEV suit from the Half-Life series.

I used [this](https://huggingface.co/Feinr4/HEV-Suit) model on [Applio](https://applio.org/) to convert the EdgeTX system sounds to sound like the HEV Suit. 

I cannot guarantee that *every* sound in this works, however every file was processed the same. Most of the common sounds work, from my limited testing. Go nuts!
